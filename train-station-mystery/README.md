## Introduction

This report presents an open-source intelligence (OSINT) investigation undertaken as part of a public challenge issued by OSINT specialist Sofia Santos. The objective of the challenge was to analyze a publicly shared photograph and determine:

- The name of the train station seen in the image  
- The name and height of the tallest structure seen in the photo

## Tools & Techniques Utilized

- Google Reverse Image Search  
- Google Maps   
- Traditional Search Engines

## Methodology & Investigation Steps

The investigation followed a structured OSINT workflow:

### 1. Initial Image Analysis
- The initial phase involved a thorough examination of the provided image. The photo revealed a sign reading "Flinders Street," providing the first crucial clue.

### 2. Train Station Identification
- Used **Google Reverse Image Search** to validate the location.
- Results strongly correlated with the **Flinders Street Railway Station**, Melbourne, Australia.
 
### 3. Street-Level Verification
- Utilized **Google Street View** to virtually navigate around the Flinders Street area, confirming architectural matches and sign placements consistent with the original photo.
  
### 4. Tallest Structure Identification
- Buildings labeled **HWT** and **IBM** were observed in the background.
- While the IBM building initially appeared to be the tallest, a deeper investigation was conducted.
- **Google Maps 3D View** was used to virtually explore the area. A background building, later identified as **FOCUS Apartments**, was determined to be taller than both IBM and HWT structures.

### 5. Height Confirmation
- Verified via search engine
- **FOCUS Apartments** stands at **166 meters**.

## Key Takeaways

- Visual clues, when paired with geospatial tools, can lead to accurate identifications.
- Perspective in a photo can be misleading, 3D tools helped spot the actual tallest structure.
- Even simple tools like Google Search and reverse image lookup can be highly effective in beginner OSINT challenges.
